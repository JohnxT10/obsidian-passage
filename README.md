## Design Choices

### Colours

### Colours

A great deal of thought went into selecting each colour for Obsidian Passage. The palette was chosen to create a mysterious, immersive atmosphere while ensuring **accessibility** and **clarity**. Each colour serves a specific purpose, from guiding the player’s focus to providing clear feedback for actions and states.

| Colour Name   | Value                                 | Usage                        |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Obsidian Black**| `#1a1a1a`                             | Background, modal overlays   |
| **Light Grey**    | `#e0e0e0`                             | Text, borders, highlights    |
| **Dark Red**      | `#8B0000`                             | Error messages, timer warning|
| **Green**         | `#4caf50`                             | Success, completion feedback |
| **Button Gradient** | `linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(0,0,0,0.25), rgba(0,0,0,0.35))` | Button backgrounds           |
| **Opposite BG**   | `var(--opposite-bg-color)`            | Button active/pressed state  |
